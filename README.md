# BA780-Analysis-of-COVID-Hospital-Admission-and-General-Hospital-Particulars

This is a group data analysis project from class BA780. fall 2024. Members include Amisha Kelkar, Huawan Zhong, Peng Zhao, Rinaldo Brendon Patel, Yucheng He, and myself. 

Motivated by COVID-19's global impact and our group's overall interest in the US healthcare system, we chose two datasets related to hospital bed usage records and general information from the U.S. Departments of Health & Human Services and the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. 

The analysis focused on studying the bed usage record from 2020 to 2022 to study the resource demand of different hospitals, factors including hospital type, hospital ownership, hospital location, state, hospital rating, etc. We want to use the trend discovered from the study to provide recommendations for future virus surges. 

Some challenges of this analysis include working with a large and messy dataset and limited time. The usefulness of columns was also a challenge for us -- many questions we prepared were not answerable by our selected dataset. Therefore, we also believe that to improve our study, one can try to incorporate more data on hospital capacity to get a better idea of the bed usage trends.
